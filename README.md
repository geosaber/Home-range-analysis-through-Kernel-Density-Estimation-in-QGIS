# Home range analysis through Kernel Density Estimation in QGIS

The model created with the Graphical Model Builder in QGIS 3.4 allows to calculate the home range for a given level of density (tipycally 50% and 95%) through Kernel Density Estimation. Kernel Density is based on the Silverman's rule of Thumb.

Please note that for a correct calculation of the home range, point locations must be in a projceted reference system (i.e. UTM). A link with a detailed description of the algorithm used is available at www.lezionigis.it (italian only).
